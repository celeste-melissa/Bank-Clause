# Bank-Clause
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This program is inspired by a Seinfield episode where the bank claims if your teller greets you with another greeting besides, "hello", the bank will pay you $100. The clause is that if the teller greets you with a greeting that begins with the letter, "h", the bank will pay you $20. The bank will pay you $100 if the teller fails to greet you with the previous conditions being, "hello" and "h". This program takes in user input and checks based on the conditions described above.
