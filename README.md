# Bank-Clause
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This program is inspired by a Seinfield episode where the bank claims if your teller greets you with another greeting besides, "hello", the bank will pay you $100. The clause is that if the teller greets you with a greeting that begins with the letter, "h", the bank will pay you $20. The bank will pay you $100 if the teller fails to greet you with the previous conditions being, "hello" and "h". This program takes in user input and checks based on the conditions described above.

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>
  Although this project was short in length, I was able to learn a couple of things in Python. The first being how to check the first letter of a string using the index count. The second thing I learned was the startswith method. This method was extremely useful and allowed me to quickly assess the first word. Intialially, I tried using the find method but that was not effective for this problem because the find method looks for the word throughout the entire string. However, I needed to make sure that the first word was in a specific position (being the first word) and the startswith method easily helped me find the position and specifiy the word.
